class ProbPath(ABC):

    A probability path transforms the distribution :math:`p(X_0)` into :math:`p(X_1)` over :math:`t=0\rightarrow 1`.

    The ``ProbPath`` class is designed to support model training in the flow matching framework. It supports two key functionalities: (1) sampling the conditional probability path and (2) conversion between various training objectives.
    Here is a high-level example

    .. code-block:: python

        # Instantiate a probability path
        my_path = ProbPath(...)

        for x_0, x_1 in dataset:
            # Sets t to a random value in [0,1]
            t = torch.rand()

            # Samples the conditional path X_t ~ p_t(X_t|X_0,X_1)
            path_sample = my_path.sample(x_0=x_0, x_1=x_1, t=t)

            # Optimizes the model. The loss function varies, depending on model and path.

class AffineProbPath(ProbPath):
    r"""The ``AffineProbPath`` class represents a specific type of probability path where the transformation between distributions is affine.
    An affine transformation can be represented as:

    .. math::

        X_t = \alpha_t X_1 + \sigma_t X_0 + \eps, \eps ~ \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)

    where :math:`X_t` is the transformed data point at time `t`. :math:`X_0` and :math:`X_1` are the source and target data points, respectively. :math:`\alpha_t` and :math:`\sigma_t` are the parameters of the affine transformation at time `t`.

    The scheduler is responsible for providing the time-dependent parameters :math:`\alpha_t` and :math:`\sigma_t`, as well as their derivatives, which define the affine transformation at any given time `t`.
